Use this API to get access to the portal's API via OAuth2.

This API can be used both to get access to the unrestricted parts of the API using the simple machine-to-machine client credentials flow (then without an end user context), and to get an end-user context access to the API, just as if you were logged in to the portal, using any of the other three OAuth2 flows.

See the list of Auth Methods and OAuth2 Authorization Flows above on how to use this API.
